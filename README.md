## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used my previous knowledge with HTML, CSS, JavaScript to help me.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
It had been a while since I had learned the specifics of web development so in order to refresh myself I looked at my past projects and tried to apply
the skills to this game. Additionally, I initially had issues with bugs in my code, but I took the time to look through it
and debug it manually, whether it was a syntax error or an error in my logic, such as the function I filled out myself. I went
through multiple trial and error processes to problem solve certain obstacles that came up throughout this project.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I was curious about how the sound factor could be expanded on in more depth, maybe syncing everything to a particualr song 
rather than just notes. Additionally, what other interactive features could be added to make this game more accessible, such as
adding keyboard clicks or other more accessible cues besides light and sound.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would add more complex elements to the game, such as getting extra hints if needed. Also, possibly allowing the user
to create their own pattern and save it as a game for other people to play would make it more interactive. Certain design elements
of the website could also be changed to match a certain theme, if I had more time.
